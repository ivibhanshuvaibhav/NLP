# NLP
Natural language processing 

It is based on my learning of NLP which I did from online sources.

short_reviews is used to test and train the Classifiers.

Instead of using only one classifier, here I have used several classifiers like:

1. Naive Bayes
2. MNB 
3. BernoulliNB
4. Logistic Regression
5. LinearSVC
6. SGDC

A vote from taken each of the algorithms and the sentiment which scored maximum votes was considered to be final.

Along with that a confidence value was also taken which was the ratio of the the positive votes or negative votes 
to the total number of votes.

sentiment_analysis.py is used to score and classify the sentiment as positive or negaive.
